## Project Description
Most of us have probably heard, that that it is very hard to find a kita spot in Berlin and other German major cities. Goal of this project was to gain more data driven insights on this situation.
How many children are there in Berlins neighborhoods, that have a right on a kita spot? How many Kita spots are there? 

Why should you be interested in the Kita Situation in Berlin if you dont have kids? 
The kita situation is a great indictaor for a countries gender equality and is a major driver in work-family support. 
Since its is mostly women who take maternal leave and stay away from work to care for the family, the availability of Kita Spots is important for womens chance to be involved  in paid labor. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
Since its is mostly women who take maternal leave and stay away from work to care for the family. The availability of Kita Spots is important for womens chance to be involved  in paid labor. 
My hypothesis is therefore, that cities with low kita capacity also have lower employment rates for women in that age group.

## Dataset
To analyze those questions, we worked with data from different sources that provide us with
1. List of all Kitas in Hamburg and Berlin, with addresss and number of spots. The data was scraped from kitanetz.de and published by Berlin Senat. The Population and Labor market data, have been derived from Statistics Berlin/Brandenburg and Statistics Hamburg North.
